<h2><b>ABOUT</b></h2>

<p>
10 Pin Shuffle is a popular mobile bowling game developed by Digital Smoke.
I gained a bit of interest in beefing up the graphics and textures in the game to fit modern standards, 
so I decided to start this project in order to document and develop modding tools for this decades old mobile game.
