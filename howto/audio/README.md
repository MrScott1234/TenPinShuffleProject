# Extracting and modifying audio files

All of 10 Pin Shuffle's audio assets are stored plainly as .wav files in the "assets" folder.

Replacing audio assets is as simple as placing a new file with an identical name, but make sure that the format is the same as the original audio.
For reference, the audio in the game by default is at 22khz and is 16 bit PCM.
