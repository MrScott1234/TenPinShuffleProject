### About

10 Pin Shuffle is a popular mobile bowling game developed by Digital Smoke.
I gained a bit of interest in beefing up the graphics and textures in the game to fit modern standards, so I decided to start this project in order to document and develop modding tools for this decades old mobile game.

### Quick Start

To get started, head over to the Github page and download the source files in the "pin_src" folder: https://github.com/MrScott1234/TenPinShuffleProject

# Assets and File Documentation

###### DISCLAIMER: This is all speculation on my part purely based on educated guesses and is subject to change.

### The Basics

All of 10 Pin Shuffle's assets are located in the "assets" folder of the extracted source files.

The assets themselves are quite small in size, amounting to a total of only 26.4 MB.

### Texture Files

Texture files are very convienently stored as simple PNG and JPG files at quite low resolutions.

###### TODO: Figure out where some textures are stored, as I cannot find where the brick or ground wood texture is located

### Sound Files

Similar to the textures, sounds are stored as .WAV files.
