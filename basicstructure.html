<h1>Basic File and Asset Structure</h1>

<p>
All of 10 Pin Shuffle's assets are located in the "assets" folder of the extracted source files.
Most but not all of them are very plainly laid out such as the UI Textures, Audio, and Game Manuals.

<p>
The assets themselves are quite small in size, amounting to a total of only 26.4 MB.
