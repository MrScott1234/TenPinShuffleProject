# Ten Pin Shuffle Project

TenPinShuffleProject is my journey in documenting, modding, and creating modding tools for the popular "10 Pin Shuffle" mobile bowling game.

Check out the [Website](https://mrscott1234.github.io/TenPinShuffleProject/) or the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/SEYkWdCf) to read up on the documentation and how to get started with modding.
