# How to extract the source files from the 10 pin shuffle .APK file

If you want to do anything with 10 Pin Shuffle, you first need the source files. This is relatively easy to do with an Android device, a copy of the game, and an .APK extractor app.

# Step 1: Get 10 Pin Shuffle onto an Android Device

This part is very easy; simply download 10 Pin Shuffle from the Google Play Store.

# Step 2: Use an .APK extractor app to get the source .APK file

Next, you need to extract the .APK file from the app itself. You will need to use some sort of .APK extractor app to do this.

# Step 3: Transfer the .APK file to your computer

Now simply use a USB cable (or any other means of transferring files) to get the .APK to your computer.

# Step 4: Extract the source files using 7zip

With the .APK now on your computer, simple open the archive in 7zip and extract as normal, as .APK files act exactly as .ZIP files.
