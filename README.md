# Ten Pin Shuffle Project

TenPinShuffleProject is my journey in documenting, modding, and creating modding tools for the popular "10 Pin Shuffle" mobile bowling game.

Check out the website to read up on the documentation.

To get started with modding, check out the instructions in the "howto" folders.

Once you're finished modding, head over to the "repackaging" folder to read up on how to repackage the modded game and get it running on a real device.
